""" This helper function takes in a bunch of information about a computer,
    and packages it up into a python dictionary to make it easier to store

    Note: because python is dynamically typed, you may not be used to seeing 
    explicit data types (str, int, etc.) listed in a python function. We're 
    going to go the extra step, because when we get to Java it'll be required!
