What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?

This assignment was pretty difficult because I didn't know how to approach it at first. Originally I couldn't think of a way 
for computer.py to have any methods, because it seemed like the procedural programming file had the resale shop class handle everything. At first, I put every method into ResaleShop and just filled computer.py with getter and setter methods, but that didn't make much sense and it was confusing to work with. Eventually, I realized that I could change inventory to link item IDs directly to computer objects rather than dictionaries of computer info. This made the rest of the resale shop class much more intuitive and easier to program, and also prevented any need for inventory to be updated manually in the computer class with something else, like super(), every time something changed. 

For anyone taking this course in the future, I'd recommend starting every assignment early, no matter how simple it seems. I looked at this assignment late, and so I had to rush a bit to reach a solution in time.
